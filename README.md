### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Naor

I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft with a BSc in Data Science & Engineering from the Technion. I'm passionate about AI, machine learning, and programming, and am always looking for new ways to solve challenging problems in these fields. In the future, I hope to start my own startup or manage a project/department in AI. In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar ðŸŽ¸, scuba diving ðŸ¤¿, skiing ðŸŽ¿, and going to music concerts and festivals ðŸŽ™. Follow me on GitHub to see my latest projects and stay updated on my work.
